# 🚀 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project  

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!  
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution** — from building a scalable data warehouse to delivering actionable business insights.  

Designed as a **portfolio project**, it highlights industry best practices in **data engineering**, **data modeling**, and **analytics reporting**.  

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture  

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold):**  

🔸 **Bronze Layer**  
Stores raw data from source systems as-is.  
Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.  

🔸 **Silver Layer**  
Applies data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare data for analytics.  

🔸 **Gold Layer**  
Contains business-ready data modeled in a **Star Schema (Fact and Dimension tables)** to support efficient reporting and insights.  

---

## 📖 Project Overview  

This project includes the following components:  

- **Data Architecture** – Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion framework.  
- **ETL Pipelines** – Extracting, transforming, and loading data from multiple source systems into the warehouse.  
- **Data Modeling** – Building optimized Fact and Dimension tables for analytical queries.  
- **Analytics & Reporting** – Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for business insights.

## 🚀 Project Requirements  

🎯 **Objective**  
Build a modern Data Warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales and customer data, enabling analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making.  

📋 **Specifications**  
- **Data Sources:** Import data from two systems — ERP and CRM — provided as CSV files.  
- **Data Quality:** Clean and fix inconsistencies before loading data into the warehouse.  
- **Integration:** Merge both sources into a single, unified analytical model.  
- **Scope:** Focus on the latest dataset only (no historization).  
- **Documentation:** Provide clear data model documentation for both technical and business users.

## 🧩 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)  

The Gold Layer of the Data Warehouse is modeled using a **Star Schema** structure, centered around the `FactSales` table and connected to its related Dimension tables.
